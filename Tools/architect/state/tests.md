# Stratocracy state — tests

> **Sole writer: `strat-test-author`.** Split out of `Tools/architect/state.md` on 2026-08-20, which is now

> **Holds:** Clause inventory, what each clause actually pins, known flakes, and instrument caveats — the places where a test asserts rather than measures.

## NEXT

- **Phase D's acceptance must not be written against seeing a Tank built.** `strat::chooseBuild`
  (it collects every buildlist entry whose `costFame <= fameTotal`, then reduces that set with
  `buildPriorityLess`) always buys the cheapest *affordable* buildlist entry; with Infantry
  (100 Fame) and Tank (300 Fame) both in `BP_StratGameMode`'s authored `AiBuildlistUnitIds`, the
  Tank entry is unreachable at the rules layer regardless of how many times it repeats — §2.9's
  "an occasional Tank" is not an observable outcome. **Corrected in phase 5's doc pass:**
  `SetBuildlistByIds`'s own doc block in `Source/StratBridge/StratBridge.h` (name it, not a line
  number — the citation had already rotted once) now states this plainly rather than claiming
  duplicates in the buildlist express a ratio; that older claim was true of what the bridge
  preserves and false of what the rules layer does with it. This is a vendored-behaviour observation for
  `E:\MultiAgent\stratocracy-crew`, not a task for this repo. See "Phase C — CLOSED" below for the
  full account.
- **`UStratMatchSubsystem::RunAiTurnsNow`'s return value is an untested production contract —
  phase D's gate must not be built on it.** A §2.8 result reached mid-turn ends with the rules
  module correctly refusing the winning side's closing EndTurn
  (`STRAT-AI refused phase=apply kind=EndTurn ... reason=[T-SAVE-05] no match is running`), so
  `FStratAiTurnRunner::RunTurn` returns `bOk = false` and `RunAiTurnsNow` returns `false` for a
  game that finished *correctly* — result, turn count, recorded log, replay parity and handover
  silence are all right; only the return value misreports. `strat-test-author` asserted neither
  `true` nor `false` (either would be wrong or would demand the defect) and instead left a
  tripwire, `AddExpectedMessagePlain(TEXT("STRAT-AI refused"), ..., Occurrences 0)` at
  `StratAiMatchClauses.cpp:610`, so a future fix to this fails loudly rather than silently.
  Carried into phase D's brief per the phase B gate's explicit instruction — see "Phase B —
  CLOSED" below for the full account.
- **The two clauses owed since phase 6 are now written and green — discharged.**
  `Stratocracy.StratPlay.T-INT-05.WaitIsDistinguishableFromAttack` and
  `.T-INT-05.WaitWithNothingSelectedIsANoOp`, in a new file
  `Source/StratPlay/Tests/StratSelectionWaitClauses.cpp` (untracked at time of writing — staging
  is the user's call). Suite **69/69**, `succeeded 69 / succeededWithWarnings 0 / failed 0 /
  notRun 0`, `reportCreatedOn 2026.08.13-16.47.36` (`Saved/AutomationReport/index.json`, read
  `utf-8-sig`); both entries `state: "Success"`. All 67 pre-existing tests still pass, none
  downgraded. `WaitIsDistinguishableFromAttack` pins that a wait and an accepted attack differ
  in the machine's *returned value* (`Command == None` naming no unit vs `Command == Attack`
  carrying `UnitId`/`Hex`), that both units end `bDone == true`, that both re-clicks refuse
  identically, and that `FStratBridge::StateHash()` is unmoved by the wait but moved by the
  attack — expectations taken from `FStratSelectionOutcome`, `AttackTargetHexes`'s own first
  element, and `StateHash()` against its own earlier reading; no hex literal, no predicted hash.
  `WaitWithNothingSelectedIsANoOp` pins the guard at `StratSelectionMachine.cpp:156-160`:
  `Command == None`, selection stays `INDEX_NONE`, a refusal reason is set, nothing joins
  `DoneUnits` (every `bDone` false on the decorated model), state hash unmoved, no `STRAT-WAIT
  spent` line emitted. Neither clause asserts the log line's *existence* — only its absence on
  the no-op path and its presence as a positive control on a real wait driven through the same
  capture in the same run; the line was never the property worth pinning, the wait/attack
  distinguishability was.
  - **Technique worth reusing: pinning a refusal string with no module-side accessor.** The
    guard's `TEXT("nothing is selected")` at `StratSelectionMachine.cpp:158` is an inline
    literal exposed by neither `FStratSelectionMachine` nor `FStratSelectionOutcome`. The clause
    does not hardcode a copy — that would fail on a harmless wording edit while still passing if
    the guard were replaced by a different arm producing a different sentence. Instead it
    asserts non-emptiness plus inequality against the machine's own done-set refusal, produced
    by the same machine in the same run.
  - **Technique worth reusing: a log-silence assertion needs a positive control.** Asserting "no
    `STRAT-WAIT spent` line appeared" is worthless if the capture cannot speak, so the clause
    first drives a real wait through the same live `GLog` capture and requires the count to rise
    before reading the silence on the guarded path — the general remedy for the failure mode
    that cost phase 6 six rounds: measuring an absence without first proving the instrument can
    register a presence.
- Standing debt, ruled out of any future phase's scope by the phase-6 reviewer: NeoStack input
  injection reaches `UGameViewportClient::InputKey` but never `UPlayerInput`, so no playtest is
  machine-repeatable. This is a NeoStack plugin issue outside this repository.
- The **owned-bridge-path leak on `AStratScoreboardHUD` is not pinned.** Proving it needs an
  allocation counter behind `FStratBridge` — offered by `strat-gameplay-engineer` during phase 2
  and **declined as new production surface beyond phase 2's exit criterion**; offered again in
  phase 3 and **declined a second time**. The tests prove the *adopted* bridge is not freed
  (`T-UI-03.EndPlayLeavesAnAdoptedBridgeUsable`); `T-INT-05.SubsystemSeedsBeforeHandover` proves
  the *consequence* that the HUD reads the subsystem's bridge and not one it allocated, but
  neither proves the owned path itself. Stated honestly in `StratScoreboardHUDSeam.cpp:31-37`.
  Out of scope for the hot-seat milestone.
- **`ETriggerEvent::Started` on all four input actions is asserted, not measured** — no input
  asset exists yet to test against. Discharged the first time the controller runs in PIE with
  real assets, i.e. no earlier than phase 5.
