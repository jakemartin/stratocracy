# Architect state

_Last run 2026-08-11 19:30 UTC._

## BUILT

- `Source/StratUI/StratScoreboardHUD.h` — applied (iteration 1, step `host_h`, live)
- `Source/StratUI/StratScoreboardHUD.cpp` — applied (iteration 1, step `host_cpp`, live)

## DECISIONS

- iteration 1: selected `scoreboard_host` at score 35; runner-up production_widget was blocked on buildlist_query

## NEXT

- `presentation_statelessness` — Presentation statelessness pass (rebuild widgets from the view model) (actionable)
- `production_widget` — Production menu widget (§2.11.5) (blocked on buildlist_query)
- `bridge_event_list` — Bridge ordered event list (§4.9 'command in / events out') (actionable)
- `buildlist_query` — Buildlist query on the Ui.h contract (actionable, excluded: shape unstated in the GDD by explicit decision, and the file is vendored certified bytes in another repo -- T-INT-01 hash-matches it)
- **Deferred, not built** — `FStratBridge::Reachable` landed at `e0cc53d` with zero tests. Its five clauses are phase 1 work (hot-seat milestone).
- **Hot-seat milestone, out of scope**: production menu (§2.11.5), guided opening (§2.11.6), info panel, toasts, save-slot UI, AI opponent, move-undo.

## Hot-seat milestone

### Phase 0 — row order proven, tests green

- **Completed:** 2026-08-12
- **Exit criterion:** "row order proven; 18/18 tests green; git status clean"
- **Met.** Units and terrain close the criterion by different mechanisms, and
  that asymmetry is deliberate, not a gap:
  - **Units — proven directly.**
    `Stratocracy.StratBridge.GATE-BRIDGE-DEFS.MappedDefsMatchLoaderOrder`
    (`Source/StratBridge/Tests/StratBridgeParity.cpp:166-231`) compares
    `FStratBridge::UnitDefs()[i]` (built from the live `.uasset` via
    `UDataTable::GetRowNames()`, `StratBridge.cpp:53-76`) against
    `strat::loadUnits` over the same vendored `units.csv`, positionally, field
    by field. This exists *because* `SaveCommandKind::Build` carries a raw
    `defIndex` in its `unitId` field (`Save.h:64`) that `applyCommand` uses as
    a direct array index with no name lookup (`Replay.good.cpp:483-487`,
    `t.units->size()` bounds check) — an order divergence there resolves the
    same log to a different unit type, silently. Passed 18/18 at HEAD
    `0a7296e` (report `Saved/AutomationReport/index.json`, reportCreatedOn
    2026.08.12-13.55.04).
  - **Terrain — ruled not load-bearing, on evidence, not a gap.** I checked a
    proposed transitive proof through T-INT-02 (Bridge.StateHash() vs the
    fixture's stateHash) and it does not hold. `Bridge.StateHash()` calls
    `strat::canonicalStateHash(GameState)`, defined in `Replay.good.cpp:224`
    over `canonicalStateBytes` (`Replay.good.cpp:149-222`) — a different
    function from `Driver.good.cpp:485`'s `stateHash(Session)`, which
    `Save.h:12-16` explicitly disclaims: *"It is NOT the `stateHash` in
    Driver.h, which is the debug driver's own digest (GATE-DRV-06) and a
    different thing."* `canonicalStateBytes` folds in turn/side, per-side fame,
    objective hex+owner, per-unit id/side/hex/hp/flags, capture progress,
    `builtThisTurn`, and pending-build hex/side/defIndex — **no terrain field
    or terrain index appears anywhere in it.** Nor is there a transitive path:
    scenario seeding resolves each hex's terrain by NAME, scanning
    `t.terrain` for `.id` match (`Replay.good.cpp:299-308`, mirrored in
    `Driver.good.cpp:336-343`), so the semantic properties attached to a hex
    (moveCost, defensePct, capturable, …) are correct regardless of the
    table's row order in that build — unlike units, no `SaveCommand` field
    carries a raw terrain-table index the way Build's `unitId` carries
    `defIndex` (`Save.h:59-68` lists all five command kinds' fields: `unitId`,
    `hex`, nothing terrain-shaped). So a `DT_Terrain` row-order divergence
    changes no semantic value, reaches no hash byte, and is not merely
    untested — it is untestable via T-INT-02 by construction, because the
    format never externalizes a terrain index the way it externalizes
    `defIndex`. `T-DATA-05.TerrainTableMatchesCsv`'s name-keyed `FindRow`
    comparison is therefore the correct and sufficient check for terrain; no
    GATE-BRIDGE-DEFS-shaped terrain test is needed. Suite is 18/18 and git
    status is clean apart from this steward's own edits.
