// GDD §4.9 part 2 -- the bridge: the only code that knows both worlds.
//
// It lives in its own `StratBridge` module and NOT in Source/StratRules/, which
// T-INT-01 requires to contain nothing unaccounted for against the recorded crew
// commit. Nothing here is vendored; nothing here is a rule.
//
// WHY ITS OWN MODULE RATHER THAN THE GAME MODULE, which is where this file first
// sat: an editor target is a MODULAR build, so each module is a DLL, and Unreal
// exports only symbols carrying an `_API` macro. The vendored `strat::` sources
// carry none -- §4.9 forbids them engine headers -- so no other module can link a
// call to them, measured as 8 x LNK2019 the first time this bridge tried. The
// rules sources are therefore compiled INTO this module (see Vendored/), and the
// exported surface is `FStratBridge`, which was written to be exported. See
// StratBridge.Build.cs.
//
// WHAT THIS OWNS: the authoritative `strat::GameState`. §4.1's "never own rules" is
// structural here rather than aspirational -- actors and UMG hold no rules state,
// because the state is in this object and they have no copy of it to drift from.
//
// WHAT THIS DECIDES: nothing. Every refusal below is a refusal the rules module
// returned, forwarded with that module's own reason. The bridge maps engine types
// to module types and carries answers back; where it would have to choose, it
// refuses instead and says why.
//
// NOT A UOBJECT, and deliberately. UHT parses headers that declare reflected types,
// and this one declares none, so the vendored `strat` headers it includes are never
// put in front of the header tool. A UMG-facing wrapper can come later without
// moving the state out of here.
//
// NOT IN THIS ROUND: the ordered event list (§4.9 part 2's "command in / events
// out") and the widgets. T-INT-02, T-INT-03 and T-SAVE-06 assert over the state
// hash and the rejection channel, which is what this file provides. The event list
// is ruled to live headless, and no acceptance ID names it as its subject.
