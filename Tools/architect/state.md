## BUILT

- `Source/StratUI/StratScoreboardHUD.h` — applied (iteration 1, step `host_h`, live)
- `Source/StratUI/StratScoreboardHUD.cpp` — applied (iteration 1, step `host_cpp`, live)

## DECISIONS

- iteration 1: selected `scoreboard_host` at score 35; runner-up production_widget was blocked on buildlist_query

## NEXT

- `presentation_statelessness` — Presentation statelessness pass (rebuild widgets from the view model) (actionable)
- `production_widget` — Production menu widget (§2.11.5) (blocked on buildlist_query)
- `bridge_event_list` — Bridge ordered event list (§4.9 'command in / events out') (actionable)
- `buildlist_query` — Buildlist query on the Ui.h contract (actionable, excluded: shape unstated in the GDD by explicit decision, and the file is vendored certified bytes in another repo -- T-INT-01 hash-matches it)
